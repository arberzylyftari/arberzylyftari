## About Me

I am a Computer Science student focused on understanding machine learning beyond surface-level implementation.

My goal is not only to train models, but to deeply understand how they behave, why they fail, and how to systematically improve them.

I am currently building projects that involve neural network implementation, model evaluation, and architecture experimentation.

## Learning Focus

- Deep Learning fundamentals  
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)  
- Model evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score)  
- Data preprocessing & augmentation strategies  
- Regularization techniques and performance tuning  
- Understanding backpropagation and gradient descent

## Current Projects

### Rock Paper Scissors – Image Classification
Developing and improving a CNN-based multi-class classification model.  
Experimenting with:
- Data augmentation strategies  
- Architecture refinement  
- Regularization techniques  
- Confusion matrix analysis  
- Macro F1-score evaluation  

### Neural Networks From Scratch
Implementing neural network components manually to understand:
- Forward propagation  
- Backpropagation  
- Gradient descent optimization  
- Model convergence behavior

## Learning Philosophy

I believe strong machine learning engineers are built through experimentation, debugging, and understanding model failures — not just achieving high accuracy scores.

I aim to continuously improve by refining architectures, analyzing results, and questioning every assumption.
